          Zaid Hassan is a Film Director born and raised in the Bay Area while currently living in Los Angeles. He graduated USC in 2023 where he studied Film Production at SCA. 

          <br> <br> As a first-generation Muslim Pakistani American, Zaid’s unique cultural background has played a significant role in shaping his artistic vision. He takes immense pride in infusing his work with undertones of Islamic and South Asian influences. Through his films, he aims to challenge stereotypes, bridge cultural gaps, and shed light on the rich tapestry of diverse experiences that exist within our society. 
          
         <br> <br> In 2023, Zaid was honored with the prestigious Islamic Scholars Fund Film Scholarship, a testament to his exceptional talent and dedication to furthering Muslim stories within the Film Industry. He was also selected as one of four directors to create a thesis film at USC in 2023. With this selection Zaid went on to direct the first Muslim South Asian thesis film fully funded by USC titled “Sultana”.
          
         <br> <br> Zaid's exceptional directorial skills have not gone unnoticed, earning him accolades and recognition. His latest work, "Sultana," has been showcased in esteemed festivals around the world and is set to receive distribution by 2024. 
          
         <br> <br> Currently, Zaid is in the process of developing his debut feature film. The project is inspired by the true story of Zaid’s brother Omar, a talented filmmaker who was diagnosed with cancer and passed away before being able to achieve his dreams. The film is an extremely personal one to Zaid and he hopes to inspire people of every age and background to pursue their dreams regardless of their circumstances.
